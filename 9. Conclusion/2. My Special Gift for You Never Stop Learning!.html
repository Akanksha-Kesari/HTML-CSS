<h4><strong>Once Again, Congratulations on Finishing the Course!</strong></h4>

<p>Now you might be wondering: "What's next?". And I&nbsp;have the perfect answer for that: <strong>learning JavaScript</strong>. And here are my 5 reasons why:</p>

<p><strong>Reason #1:</strong> JavaScript brings websites and web apps to live<br></p>

<p><strong>Reason #2: </strong>JavaScript can be used on the back-end as well<br></p>

<p><strong>Reason #3: </strong>JavaScript is fast to get started with<br></p>

<p><strong>Reason #4:</strong> JavaScript developers are in high demand and highly paid<br></p>

<p><strong>Reason #5:</strong> JavaScript is the future of the internet<br></p>
