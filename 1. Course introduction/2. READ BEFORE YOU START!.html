<p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS LECTURE CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU START THE ACTUAL COURSE. THANK YOU!</strong><br></p>

<h4><strong>How to ask for help?</strong></h4>























<p>I hope you're excited after seeing the final Omnifood project!&nbsp;Now, as you go through the course, you might have a question&nbsp;about a specific topic, or get stuck in a coding lecture and need help.</p>























<p>Whenever that happens, you can get help in the official course Q&A section. My Teaching Assistant Aleksander or I myself will be there answering your questions as fast as possible!</p>























<p><em>To use the official course Q&A, please follow the following steps:</em>
</p>























<ol><li>Start by spending some time trying to solve the problem on your own. This is very important for your learning process!</li><li><em>To find errors, compare your code with the downloadable code for each section.</em>&nbsp;Use a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.diffchecker.com/"  rel="nofollow">diffchecker</a>&nbsp;for that.</li><li>Check if your question has already been asked before in the relevant&nbsp;lecture.</li><li>If you canâ€™t solve the problem,&nbsp;you will get help in the Q&A!</li><li>If you have&nbsp;a small piece of code, please post it to the Q&A along with the question.&nbsp;<em>For longer code, please post it to a new&nbsp;</em><em>codepen (</em><a href="http://codepen.io/pen/" target="_blank"  rel="nofollow">http://codepen.io/pen/</a>), hit save, copy your link and share it in the Q&A.</li><li>Explain your problem very specifically:&nbsp;that makes answering easier.</li></ol>























<p>We will try to help you as soon as possible, or also&nbsp;a fellow student might help you. Many students actually find that helping others helps themselves&nbsp;getting&nbsp;better and better at coding.</p>

<h4><strong>Have Fun With the Course!</strong></h4>























<p>I have built this course for you, and I want you to be as successful as possible with it!</p>























<p>Here is how:</p>























<ul><li><em>Watch all the lectures in the course, as they follow a logical structure, from the first to the last lecture.</em></li><li>Follow everything I do in the videos, step-by-step.</li><li>Take notes of important concepts or code parts, it will become very valuable later!</li><li>Watch the lectures in HD to see everything that I do.</li></ul>























<p><em><strong>And most importantly: don't give up, even when things start to look more difficult. At the end of the course, you will get the full picture and be proud of the projects&nbsp;you have built!</strong></em></p>

<h4><strong>The Early Review Prompt</strong></h4>























<figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com/redactor/2016-11-20_10-35-53-94b4ba282aa1e15bee8883999e905807/early-review.png" width="498" style="cursor: pointer;"></figure>























<p>Udemy will ask you to review the course very early, after about 8% of the course.</p>























<p><em>In my opinion, the early review prompt is not fair for instructors, because right in the beginning of the course you have not actually learned anything.</em></p>























<p><strong>So instead of giving a rating/review right at the beginning, I'd appreciate if you could wait to give the course an honest review until you have actually learned something.</strong></p>























<p><strong>Thank you, I really appreciate it!</strong></p>
