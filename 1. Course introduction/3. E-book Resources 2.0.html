<p>In April 2016 I updated the resources that I provided you in the ebook that came with this course, because I was feeling some important ones were missing and others were getting outdated.</p>





<p><em>So here are the Resources 2.0, which now come as a new super-sexy webpage rather than a static PDF file! And it’s all for free, of course. I keep working hard to make this course as good as I can, and having great resources to work with is absolutely essential for you. The new resources now contain 60+ links spread across 10 categories, and I will keep updating it!</em></p>

<p>Please share the new resources page with friends or colleagues, it might be useful to them, too. They will thank you later!<br></p><p>The website reflects my brand new company CodingHeroes, which is now the home of my current and future courses. I also updated my Facebook page, YouTube channel and Twitter. In case you don’t know them, here they are:</p>
